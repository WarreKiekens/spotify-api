# spotify-api
## Description
This is an assignment I made for my course: Emerging Technologies. I had to create a cmd-interface which can query the spotify api. I used [python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) as underlying engine. 


I made my own expension on this assignment, which is the webapplication. I used javascript to query the spotify api and visualize it in the brower. You can search for tracks and artists.

## Setup
**1. Request api keys**  
**2. Download repo**

## CMD
### Installation
install python, pip, requirements
fill in credentials
### Webapplication
open index.html, fill in credentials
